# GitHub API tools for Plan 9

These tools provide a direct interface to GitHub's v3 API.  Their
purpose is ease of use and practicality for somewhat "heavy" GitHub
users residing in plan 9(front) systems that want to avoid the webshit
interface.

Read the code and fill-in your token in `gh`, then install.

I'll provide some examples and a manpage once I'm done with them.
